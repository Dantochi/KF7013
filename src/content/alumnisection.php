                        <p>Attending a cohort in transit was one of the best decisions I ever made to take myself to the
                            next level in tech. The project sessions were very intense, I gotta say but it gave me a
                            smooth
                            transition into the tech world. In no time I got a job. </p>

                        <p>Iâ€™m short of words honestly... They were the hand I needed to lead me in the right direction
                            in the area of UI/UX. The project session inspired me to begin a start up.</p>
